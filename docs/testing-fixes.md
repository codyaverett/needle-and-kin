# Testing Fixes - December 29, 2024

## Overview
Fixed all failing tests in the project. All 255 tests are now passing successfully.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Testing Dependency
**Problem:** CommentList tests were failing due to missing `@pinia/testing` package.
**Solution:** Installed `@pinia/testing` as a dev dependency via `pnpm add -D @pinia/testing`.

### 2. Missing Component Import
**Problem:** CommentList component was using CommentItem in template but not importing it.
**Solution:** Added import statement for CommentItem component in CommentList.vue.

### 3. Test Selector Issues
**Problem:** Multiple tests were using incorrect selectors for Vue Test Utils v2.
**Solution:** Updated all tests to use `wrapper.findAll()` with proper array filtering instead of deprecated `.filter()` method.

### 4. CommentItem Reply Event Test
**Problem:** Test was not properly finding and clicking the submit button for reply functionality.
**Solution:** Fixed button selection logic to correctly identify the submit button vs the reply toggle button.

### 5. RichTextEditor Preview Test
**Problem:** Test was looking for `.prose` class that only exists when preview is shown.
**Solution:** Updated selector to check for `.bg-gray-50 .prose` to properly identify preview container.

### 6. View Tracking Test
**Problem:** Duplicate view prevention test was using shared state between test runs.
**Solution:** Used unique IP address for the test to avoid state conflicts with other tests.
