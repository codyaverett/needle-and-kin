# Needle & Kin Blog - Project Setup Documentation

## Project Overview

Needle & Kin is a blog website focused on crafting, creativity, and the connections made through handmade art. The project was built using Nuxt 3 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and server-side rendering capabilities. 

**Current Version: 2.0.0** - Features a complete dynamic content management system where all site content is served through dedicated server API endpoints, providing exceptional maintainability and scalability.

## Initial Project State

The project started as a basic Nuxt 3 application that had been migrated from Vue CLI, but was experiencing rendering issues. The initial assessment revealed:

- Nuxt 3.18.1 with Nitro 2.12.4 installed
- Basic Vue components from previous Vue CLI setup
- Empty layouts directory
- Minimal configuration
- Package management using pnpm

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Project Analysis and Planning

1. **Examined the existing codebase structure:**
   - Reviewed `package.json` for dependencies and scripts
   - Analyzed `nuxt.config.ts` configuration
   - Inspected existing pages and components
   - Confirmed Nuxt 3 was properly installed and configured

2. **Identified the core requirements:**
   - Fix any rendering issues
   - Create a professional blog layout
   - Add navigation and header components
   - Implement server-side API endpoints
   - Ensure responsive design

### Phase 2: Core Architecture Setup

1. **Created the default layout system:**
   - Built `layouts/default.vue` with header, main content area, and footer
   - Implemented responsive container structure
   - Added SEO-friendly meta tags and Google Fonts integration

2. **Developed navigation components:**
   - `components/AppHeader.vue` - Responsive navigation with mobile menu
   - `components/AppFooter.vue` - Site footer with links and social media
   - Implemented sticky header with proper z-index layering

3. **Established design system:**
   - Integrated Tailwind CSS via `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module
   - Created `assets/css/main.css` with Tailwind imports
   - Set up Inter font family as the primary typeface
   - Configured responsive breakpoints and container styles

### Phase 3: Blog Functionality

1. **Created blog post components:**
   - `components/BlogCard.vue` - Reusable post card with image, title, excerpt, author
   - Implemented hover effects and responsive grid layouts
   - Added proper semantic HTML structure

2. **Built page templates:**
   - `pages/index.vue` - Homepage with hero section, latest posts, and about section
   - `pages/blog/index.vue` - Blog listing page with tag filtering and pagination
   - Implemented proper Nuxt 3 patterns for data fetching

3. **Designed content structure:**
   - Purple and pink gradient theme for branding
   - Card-based layout for blog posts
   - Clear typography hierarchy
   - Call-to-action buttons and links

### Phase 4: Server-Side API Development

1. **Created blog API endpoints:**
   - `server/api/posts/latest.get.ts` - Returns the 3 most recent blog posts
   - `server/api/posts/index.get.ts` - Returns all posts with pagination and tag filtering
   - Implemented mock data with realistic crafting-related content

2. **API features implemented:**
   - Query parameter support for pagination (`page`, `limit`)
   - Tag filtering functionality
   - Structured response format with metadata
   - Author information and post metadata

3. **Mock data structure:**
   - 5 sample blog posts about embroidery, knitting, upcycling, cross-stitch, and macrame
   - Realistic publication dates and read times
   - Author profiles with avatars and bios
   - Tag system for categorization

### Phase 5: Dynamic Content System (Version 2.0.0)

1. **Complete content transformation:**
   - Converted all static content to dynamic server-driven content
   - Implemented comprehensive content management API system
   - Separated content from presentation for enhanced maintainability

2. **New content API endpoints:**
   - `server/api/about.get.ts` - Complete about page content
   - `server/api/site-content.get.ts` - Homepage dynamic content
   - `server/api/contact-info.get.ts` - Contact page content and configuration
   - `server/api/blog-config.get.ts` - Blog configuration and available tags

3. **Page transformations:**
   - **Homepage**: Hero and about sections now server-driven
   - **About page**: All content (story, mission, team, CTA) dynamically loaded
   - **Contact page**: Form configuration, contact methods, and FAQ all dynamic
   - **Blog page**: Tag filtering uses server-configured tags

4. **Component cleanup:**
   - Removed unused `HelloWorld.vue` component (Vue CLI leftover)
   - Verified all remaining components are actively used
   - Optimized component architecture with no dead code

### Phase 6: Technical Configuration

1. **Package management:**
   - Used pnpm for all package installation and management
   - Installed `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module for styling
   - Configured proper dependency resolution

2. **Nuxt configuration updates:**
   - Added Tailwind CSS module to `nuxt.config.ts`
   - Configured global CSS imports
   - Set up proper head management for SEO
   - Added Google Fonts integration

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Hydration Mismatch
**Problem:** The homepage loaded blank initially and only rendered after navigation.

**Root Cause:** Using `$fetch` instead of `useFetch` for data fetching, causing server-side rendering and client-side hydration mismatch.

**Solution:**
- Replaced `$fetch` with `useFetch` for proper SSR/hydration handling
- Added loading states with conditional rendering
- Implemented null checks with optional chaining (`?.`)
- Used computed properties for reactive data handling

**Files Modified:**
- `pages/index.vue` - Changed data fetching pattern
- `pages/blog/index.vue` - Updated to use reactive computed properties

### Issue 2: Static HTML Override
**Problem:** The application was serving a static `public/index.html` file instead of Nuxt-generated content, showing Vue CLI template HTML.

**Root Cause:** Leftover `public/index.html` file from previous Vue CLI setup was overriding Nuxt's dynamic HTML generation.

**Solution:**
- Removed the conflicting `public/index.html` file
- Allowed Nuxt to generate its own HTML structure
